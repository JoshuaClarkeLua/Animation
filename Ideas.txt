- Start by adjusting the height of the character based on the slope angle
	to make sure both feet can touch the ground without hyperextending.
	(i.e. the knees should be bent a bit)

- IK should activate only when the feet are nearly touching ground.
	Otherwise, it will prevent the animation from moving the legs up and down.

- NOTE: Animation controller overrides Motor6D after RunService.PreAnimation but BEFORE RunService.Stepped
		I.e. when RunService.Stepped is called, the Motor6D is in the correct position of the animation.
